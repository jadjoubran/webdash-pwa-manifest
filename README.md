npm install --save-dev webdash-pwa-manifest
```

## Features

Preview your Web App Manifest on Android:

* Icon on homescreen
* Splash screen
* Status bar theme color

## Configuration

This plugin looks for `manifestPath` in your `webdash.json` configuration file, and defaults to `./src/manifest.json` if it's not set.

You may need to fix your `manifestPath` for this plugin to work.
